      <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Norman Ernest Borlaug
          March 25, 1914</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
          University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
          "National Youth Administration"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
          in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
          how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
          Forestry Service
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
          laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
          returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
          pest-resistent plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
          Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
          work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
          other applied science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
          leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
          pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
          different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
          varieties for each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
          season, doubling wheat yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
          with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
          well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
          strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
          mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
        </li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
          increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&amp;M
          University
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
          supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
          we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
          are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
          plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
          people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Borlaug died of lymphoma at the age of 95, on September 12, 2009, in his Dallas
          home.

          Borlaug's children released a statement saying, "We would like his life to be a model for making a difference
          in the lives of others and to bring about efforts to end human misery for all mankind."

          The Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and President of India Pratibha Patil paid tribute to Borlaug
          saying, "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering
          intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."

          The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) described Borlaug as "a towering scientist whose
          work rivals that of the 20th century's other great scientific benefactors of humankind" and Kofi Annan, former
          Secretary-General of the United Nations said, "As we celebrate Dr. Borlaug's long and remarkable life, we also
          celebrate the long and productive lives that his achievements have made possible for so many millions of
          people around the world... we will continue to be inspired by his enduring devotion to the poor, needy and
          vulnerable of our world.</li>
